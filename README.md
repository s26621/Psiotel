Psiotel is a fake dog hotel website that allows users to create accounts and manage data related to clients, dogs, and reservations.

It’s a single-page application that features user authentication, form validation, support for multiple user roles, dynamic page rendering, and real-time language switching between Polish and English. All data operations — creating, reading, updating, and deleting — can be performed entirely through the UI, without need to interact directly with the backend.

The frontend is built with React, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, while the backend is powered by Node.js.
